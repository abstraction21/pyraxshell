pyraxshell
======
CLI tool and interpreter to manage [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) and [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) Cloud products.
It leverages [pyrax](https://github.com/rackspace/pyrax) module, therefore it aims to expose all the features implemented in *pyrax*. 

Watch *pyraxshell* in action:

**ATTENTION** *pyraxshell* is currently in development stage, therefore it should be used for testing purposes only.

## Installation

### From sources
Just clone the [pyraxshell repository](https://github.com/siso/pyraxshell) on [Github](https://github.com/) and run it:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/siso/pyraxshell
$ cd pyraxshell
$ python pyraxshell
```

## Authentication
*pyraxshell* supports three different authentication methods: credentials file, login and token.

### Credentials file
Create ```~/.pyrax.cfg``` file with your credentials:

```
cat > ~/.pyrax.cfg << EOF
[rackspace_cloud]
identity_type=rackspace
username = USERNAME
api_key = APIKEY
region = REGION
EOF
```

then simply run ```python pyraxshell``` and *pyraxshell* will try to authenticate with *~/.pyrax.cfg* credentials.

### Login
Run *pyraxshell* and enter login credentials:

```
$ python pyraxshell
H>auth
H auth>login identity_type:rackspace username:USERNAME apikey:APIKEY region=REGION
```

### Token
Run *pyraxshell* and enter your token:

```
$ python pyraxshell
H>auth
H auth>token token:TOKEN tenantId:TENANTID identity_type:IDENTITYTYPE region:REGION
```

## Quickstart

### Using pyraxshell interactively

*pyraxshell* can be executed **interactively**, so you can start experimenting [OpenStack](http://www.openstack.org/) and [Rackspace](http://www.rackspace.com/) with few simple commands:

```
$ python pyraxshell
H>
```
hit ```TAB-TAB``` to auto-complete:

```
H>
EOF        auth       databases  endpoints  help       servers    test
H>auth
EOF               credentials       is_authenticated  print_identity    token
change_password   help              login             print_token
```

authenticate:

```
H auth>login identity_type:rackspace username:MYUSERNAME apikey:MYAPIKEY region=LON
```

return to the previous menu/interpreter ```CTRL-D```:

```
H auth>
H>servers
H servers>
EOF           delete        help          list_flavors  
create        details       list          list_images   
H servers>list_flavors
+----+-------------------------+-------+------+-------+
| id |           name          |  ram  | swap | vcpus |
+----+-------------------------+-------+------+-------+
| 2  | 512MB Standard Instance |  512  | 512  |   1   |
...
```

and so on, you have got the idea. No need to learn anything new, just use it as you would do with any other interpreter, with history, auto-completion, *etc*.

#### Default values
If a parameter has a default value, then it is considered optional:

```
H dns>help create_domain

        create a domain
        
        Parameters:
        
        name               name of the domain
        email_address    
        ttl                TTL (optional, default:900)
        comment            (optional, default:void)
```

### Using pyraxshell non-interactively

Running *pyraxshell* **non-teractively** is pretty easy, and it is the best way to automate tasks. Just create a text file with the commands you want to run:

```
$ cat > commands.txt << EOF
auth
login identity_type:rackspace username:MYUSERNAME apikey:MYAPIKEY region=LON
exit
servers
list_flavors
EOF
```

and *pipe* that to standard input:

```
$ cat commands.txt | python pyraxshell
...
+----+-------------------------+-------+------+-------+
| id |           name          |  ram  | swap | vcpus |
+----+-------------------------+-------+------+-------+
| 2  | 512MB Standard Instance |  512  | 512  |   1   |
...
```

To use *comments* start a line with '#', then run:

```$ cat commands.txt | grep -v "^#" | python pyraxshell```

i.e.:

```
$ cat > commands.txt << EOF
# THIS IS A COMMENT
# AUTHENTICATE
auth
login identity_type:rackspace username:MYUSERNAME apikey:MYAPIKEY region=LON
# EXIT AUTHENTICATION SUB-INTERPRETER
exit
# ENTER SERVERS MENU
servers
# LIST FLAVORS
list_flavors
EOF
```

See ```./scripts``` directory which contains some examples.

## Features
*pyraxshell* leverages its *plugins system* to provide users with all its features.
Please, read ```PLUGINS.md``` to know more about the *pyraxshell plug-ins system*, and feel free to poke around ```./pyraxshell/plugins``` directory too!

## Logging
*Logging* to *stdout* and to file ```/tmp/pyraxshell.log``` is enabled by default. It can be configured according to your needs, just edit ```./conf/logging.conf```, and refer to [Logging facility for Python](http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

## Roadmap
